# SST-gradients

Here is a [document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/stvqsrhygcnt) of derivations that serve as motivation for why we care about the squared gradient of temperature and density in order to determine multiple things like quantifying the transformation rate due to lateral diapycnal mixing and associated cabbeling by near-surface mesoscale eddy stirring.
